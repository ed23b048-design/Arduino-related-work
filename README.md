Arduino sensor actuator integration 

I this repository we will try to integrate a sensor (Potentiometer) with an actuator (Buzzer / led). We will try to show you how the actuator will actuate when the sensor data crosses a threshold.

Electronic componets used:
1) Potentiometer as sensor
2) Buzzer and Led as actuator
