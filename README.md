Arduino sensor actuator integration 

I this repository we will try to integrate a sensor (Potentiometer) with an actuator (Buzzer / led). We will try to show you how the actuator will actuate when the sensor data crosses a threshold.

Electronic componets used:
1) Potentiometer as sensor
2) Buzzer and Led as actuator
3) LCD for displaying

Connections:
1) Potentiometer connected to A3 analog pin.
2) Buzzer connected to digital pin 8.
3) LED connected digital pin 3.
4) LCD- Register 11, Enable- 12, contrast- GND, read mode- GND, digital pins- 7,6,5,4
